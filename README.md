# Supervised-Intent-classification-models-for-text-messages
The intent classification task aims to tag utterance or sen- tences with a predefined label. Intent classification models can be either rule-based and deep learning-based. The rule based methods aim to classify the intents using pre-defined rules and requires deep domain knowledge where as deep learning-based models aim to classifies the intents by learning the inherent pat- terns between text and their labels. Minaee et al. Classical machine learning models require handcrafted features to be fed into a classifier for intent prediction. With the advancement in the word embedding [33] and neural network architectures, neural based intent classification models are able to map the text vector into a low-dimensional feature vector and extract the key features to predict the intent. We approach the intent classification task using supervised deep learning models
