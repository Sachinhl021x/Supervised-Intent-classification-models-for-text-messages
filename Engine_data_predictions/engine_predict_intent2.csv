7667,okay,NAN
7668,im at 75,Selected design parameter values for objective(s)
7669,3.42,NAN
7670,does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3,Tradeoff between objectives
7671,ok,NAN
7672,Thanks,NAN
7673,connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago,NAN
